* Write a program for the hangman game that randomly picks a word from a text file named hangman.txt and prompts the user to guess one letter at a time, as       shown in the sample run in java.

  Each letter in the word is displayed as an asterisk. When the user makes a correct guess, the actual letter is displayed.

  If the user misses the same letter more than one time give an extra hint to the player like
  "You've already tried this letter, try another letter". Don't count twice the same letter which the user misses.

  When the user finishes a word, the following steps should happen to Display the number of misses to the user.

  Ask the user to give you a new word, then add that word to your file hangman.txt.

  Have a minimum 10 words of your choice in the file hangman.txt
